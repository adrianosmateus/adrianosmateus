## 👨🏻‍🦲 About me

My name is Adriano Mateus dos Santos. I was born in 1995 in the city of Pindorama, state of Sao Paulo - Brazil.

Since when i was a kid, i've been around by technology thanks to my older brother and my uncle.

At 14 years old, i started to think "what should i work with?". IT was never an option...

Then, with any expectations, i subscribed to a informatic technician course, thinking that i was going to learn how to configure servers, build computers and use Excel(yes, Excel). But, at the moment one of the lessons was about database modeling and management, i saw that and thinked "Whoa, thats damm interesting, cooler than building up a shop network!".

Since that moment, i began to digging deeper into IT, with coding, DevOps, AI and game development, and i have no intentions of stopping.
